**`Electrical Engineer`**

Hello, I'm Amaury, nice to meet you!<br />

I'm an electrical engineer originally from China. I specialize in PLC, robotics, and SCADA.<br />

I'm really interested in programming!<br />

This is just a little something I do for fun. If you find my code useful, please feel free to take it and use it. I would be really happy if you did!
<br />
